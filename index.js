const message = `Hello, my name is SÃ©bastien, and I am a 16-year-old high school student from France. I am a software developer and full-stack Roblox game developer, passionate about technology, programming, and design. My expertise lies in LuaU and ForgeScript, which I have mastered, alongside strong skills in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and Roblox development.

I have experience creating Discord bots, developing innovative tools, and building complex game systems. My focus is on mastering game mechanics, UI/UX design, and web development, as these are key areas that drive my projects. I thrive in team environments, where collaboration fuels creativity and learning, allowing me to grow both personally and professionally.

Currently, I am dedicated to a major project while continuing to expand my knowledge in GUI design, advanced scripting, and full-stack game development. My dream is to become a self-employed entrepreneur, turning my ideas into impactful and sustainable tools.

Beyond development, I have a deep passion for music and have played the piano for over 9 years. One of my aspirations is to teach piano, sharing my love for music with others. I also enjoy hiking, as it helps me recharge and find inspiration in nature.

I am committed to learning, building, and creating technology that makes a difference, while staying connected to my passions in life.`
